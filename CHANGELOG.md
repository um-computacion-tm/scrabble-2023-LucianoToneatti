## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.4] - 2023-08-29

### Added

I made changes to the "player" folder to improve it and redefine old functions with new ones.
Added the ability to get tiles from the bag, swap tiles, and calculate score based on placed word cells.

## [0.0.3] - 2023-08-29

### Added

Player
He starts his hand with the 7 tiles in the bag. You can also exchange shares for tokens using the exchange method.
Test Players.
When creating a player, check if he has 7 tiles in his hand.
Check that a player's chip exchange does not change their hand or the number of chips in their bag.
BagTiles now wraps all tiles with the correct value.
I also added in "models" all the tetras with their corresponding values.

## [0.0.2] - 2023-08-28

### Added
    
In a folder named "cell.py" define the class "Cell", which represents a cell on the game board. The cell can contain a letter and has attributes to store the type and value of the multiplier. Also, it has methods to add letters to the cell and calculate the total value of the cell.

I create the "board.py" folder and inside it I made the "board" class. It also creates an array to form the board (represented by instances of the "Cell" class)

Create the class and define the "Player" class in a folder named "player.py", which represents a player in the game. The class has attribute tiles that store the letters available to the player.

Define a class called "ScrabbleGame" in the "scrabble.py" folderr. This represents the game in its entirety. The class contains attributes for the board, the bag of letters, and a list of players.  

Create the correspond tests.

## [0.0.1] - 2023-08-28

### Added

Create the classes "Tile" and "BagTiles".

Inside the "Tile" class we define the variables "letter" and "value".

Inside the "BagTiles" class and give each letter a value.

Create methods "take" and "put" in the class "BagTiles" and create the correspond tests.
